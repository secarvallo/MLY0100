    "Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs, often associated with smoking but also linked to factors like air pollution, genetic predisposition, and exposure to toxins such as asbestos and radon. It is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally, as it is often diagnosed in advanced stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), the most common form, and Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC), which is more aggressive but less common.\n",
    "\n",
    "Symptoms include persistent cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and unexplained weight loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early detection through screenings such as low-dose CT scans significantly improves outcomes.\n",
    "Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies, tailored to the cancer's type and stage.\n",

    "Preventive measures like avoiding smoking and reducing exposure to environmental risk factors are key to reducing lung cancer incidence.\n",

    "### How to use the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, accounting for 1.59 million deaths in 2018. The majority of lung cancer cases are attributed to smoking,\n",
    "but exposure to air pollution is also a risk factor. A new study has found that air pollution may be linked to an increased risk of lung cancer, even in nonsmokers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study, which was published in the journal Nature Medicine, looked at data from over 462,000 people in China who were followed for an average of six years.\n",
    "The participants were divided into two groups: those who lived in areas with high levels of air pollution and those who lived in areas with low levels of air pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers found that the people in the high-pollution group were more likely to develop lung cancer than those in the low-pollution group. They also found that the\n",
    "risk was higher in nonsmokers than smokers, and that the risk increased with age.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this study does not prove that air pollution causes lung cancer, it does suggest that there may be a link between the two. More research is needed to confirm these\n",
    "findings and to determine what effect different types and levels of air pollution may have on lung cancer risk\n",
